    "We are going to build to help users keep track of all the concerts they have attended.  There will be many models, including both one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.  This will be challanging, but doable given all our practice in the previous sections.  Whenever necessary, refer back to the previous labs to review the syntax for creating one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.\n",
